		<h1>What is ZYGOT & ZERP</h1>
				
					<p>ZERP is a platform for decentralised Open Source Intelligent ERP solution that utilises the advantages of blockchain technology. Zygot is the team that designed and facilitates the development of ZERP decentralised platform. And ZERP’s coins are Zygots. ZERP has "lightweight" character, offering accessible and affordable decentralised ERP architecture available for all company sizes - micro, SME, corporate, institutional, … We hope to provide the benefits of ERP systems to users and collaborators with various budgets, profiles, needs. The foundation of ZERP is decentralisation of actors. On one side, the users can benefit from open-source high quality ERP modules that compose a system, and participate in its continuous improvement and maintenance; while the teams of developers are also decentralised and there is no single provider, but numerous teams (compositions) of developers that address and compete through the principles of user requirements satisfaction and upward push of quality. We are introducing a dashboard and ZERP engines for facilitating the collaboration. EOS blockchain’s peer-to-peer networking, distributed validation and smart contracts will represent to build the ZERP platform that is generic enough to cover the entire supply-net of diverse domains and businesses and become the unifying ERP platform of the business ecosystems beyond tomorrow.</p>

			<h1>Blockchain EOS&ZERP</h1>
				
				<p>One of the main reasons for the ZERP and EOS integration compared to, Etherium, is because the chain processing is much faster with EOS, and their ambition to maximise the speed and number of transactions processed, complements with ZERP’s needs.<br>
				EOS is designed to be useful for busy entrepreneurs, through holistic model and approach, designed to solve issues once and for all and bring focus, discipline and accountability (reference:  https://www.eosworldwide.com/why-eos-works ) - all of these principles are working towards our integration, affirming our belief and choice that the integration with EOS will produce synergic and emergent effects.<br>
				EOS platform will support the workflow management to be very secure and reliable for the companies.The blockchain will enable traceability in production, WMS, CRM, Supply Chain Management, HR, Project Management, and disable untracked data changes.<br>
				Each company would integrate different ZERP modules to cover its business processes. Each of the modules means processing encrypted data in chains - ensuring trusted environment to respond to the trust-less expectations. We are also chaining the logs and important subsequent steps that lead to any given status to enable traceability, integrity and consistency. <br>
				<span id="text">Electronic document exchange between the companies with crypto- and smart-contract protection will support the business process management released of many manual manipulations that drain precious resources. One direct advantage is reduction of costs that service the functions which with ZERP integration transfer to blockchain. <br>
				The smart contracts reduce the need of intermediating authority that would oversee and facilitate the contract settlement. They provide security and safety, along with confirmation of the electronic document exchange. Of course, when one key player such as central authority is removed from the ecosystem, the duration of the processes and the costs get reduced, as well as the business processes that need to be automatised - can be, in the most efficient manner. <br>
				The integrity of the chained data allows tracking of the data inserts and updates. The auditing and tracking of inserted and altered data are simplified - and numerous more data chain advantages, such as confidentiality due to the encryption and chaining. <br>
				To conclude: ZERP AND EOS<br>
				We are building upon what EOS brings as foundation: <br>
				- Blockchain technology <br>
				- EOS uses ‘smart contracts’ technology, allowing strangers to enter into agreement in a trust-less environment <br>
				- It is designed as a platform for decentralised applications <br> 
				- EOS are planning to process and scale to millions of EOS transactions per second - which makes it the most scalable blockchain in the industry, being able to handle any real-world application <br>
				- NO transaction fees to pay when sending and receiving funds. 
				EOS can achieve instant, free and millions of EOS transactions per second  <br> 
				- EOSIO software is free to use for derivations projects</span>

		<h1>The ZERP backbone</h1>
		
		<div class="row_2">
			<div class="column_1">
				<p>The ZERP software development will benefit from the know-how that our team (in this project also named ZYGOT) has engineered in the past 25 years working on ERP projects (cloud and on-premise) and combined IT/Management/Academic/Entrepreneurial experience of the core founders of over 80 years. <br>
				Our existing ERP software is named VERP (derived from Vertex ERP). 
				</p>
				<p>VERP is enterprise solution is software designed to enable complete enterprise resource planning and management. With its modular organisation it enables timely information flows, accuracy, precision and simple user interfaces towards collaboration.<br>
				The visual interface enables easy and fluent acquisition of information, reports and results.  
				<br>
				The programme is conceptually designed with modules that represent logical units, enabling the users choose the appropriate module according own needs and problems to be solved. oxEnterpriseSolution is flexible enough to provide fast adaptation to new needs and developments. oxEnterprise Solution is scalable according the company size, which makes it the best choice for small companies, but also, due to its robustness, scalability and modularity - companies with complicated hierarchical or other kind of organisational structure. It has the following modules:<br>
				•	Accounting and Financials;<br>
				•	Warehouse and stock management; <br>
				•	Retail and fiscalisation;<br>
				•	Production, norms and creation of work-orders; <br>
